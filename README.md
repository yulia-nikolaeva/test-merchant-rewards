# 🏪 Merchant Rewards

**Buy local. Grow together.**

## 💡 The Idea

Create a merchant reward network that connects Business Account users through a cross-merchant cashback system. When a Teya merchant makes a purchase at another Teya merchant, they receive **extra cashback** for staying within the ecosystem.

**Example:** *"Have a coffee at Onion Garden ☕ and get extra cashback for supporting a fellow Teya merchant."*

This promotes merchant-to-merchant spending, boosts retention, and enhances local ecosystem growth.
